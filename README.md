# 🧠 Text Steganography with AES Encryption 🔐

> ✨ This project was implemented as a personal learning exercise to understand **image-based steganography**, **encryption with AES**, and building a **GUI in Python**. The code structure and techniques are based on existing methods and public resources, modified and built upon to deepen my understanding.

## 📚 Project Objective

The main goal of this project was to explore **how secret messages can be hidden inside image files using LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography**, and how to enhance the security using **AES encryption with a user key**. The project was also an opportunity to practice GUI building with `Tkinter`.
